# You&Bee
## Concept:
You&Bee is an android application designed for small business which are from apiculture domain and its consumers.
Main idea is to establish connection between consumer and producer: provides a list of all available products such as honey, different tools for bees etc.

### Real Implementation:
Currently it has Log and Sign In page,for the future will be replaced by Google SSO.
Instead of products list it shows a list of potential meals, which can be prepared with honey or contains it as main ingredient.

### APIs:
  * GoRest - get and create user
  * Edamam - get recipes which contains honey as an ingredient
